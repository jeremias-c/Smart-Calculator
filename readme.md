# Smart Calculator

Practiced my python by creating a "smart" calculator that supports complex expressions, variables, and commands. The calculator uses the [Shuntingyard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm), and gave me opportunity to practice many of python's core concepts.

## About the program
- Enter your math equation with each number and symbol separated by a space. Equal signs and parentheses don't need space separation.
- This calculator supports unary and binary minus operators. (Unary as in: -2) (Binary as in: 3 - 4)
- Use variables in your equations only after you have already assigned them. Enter them alone to see their value.
- Extra spaces do not affect result.
- Use the `/exit` and `/help` commands as needed.

## Final Thoughts
This program was very rewarding, allowing me to practice my python and work with new concepts and algorithms. Although this project was updated to Github much later, it was originally completed around *10/5/2020*.
